# COMP3015-CW2
## COMP3015 CW2's OpenGL coureswork Overview

### Run the .exe
#### To start open the folder and run the executable "Project_Template"
#### This will open into a small window

### Run the Project from repo
#### To start download the repository
#### When in project set to x64 Debug and then run

#### To move around the the use of the W,A,S,D keys will allow you to move in each direation (W = Forward, A = Left, S = Backwards, D = Right) These movements can be used at the same time to achieve a combination AKA W+A = 45 degrees forward
#### To look around, the use of the mouse allows the player to look wherever they wish whilst holding down the left mouse button

### Environment
#### This project was created using Visual Studios 2022 Community with C++

### Features 

This project includes features such as :
PBR Shading - I have fully implemented PBR Lighting, objects within the scene react to the change in light position and the appearance changes based on this
BlinnPhong Shading - I have conjoined both PBR and BlinnPhong together to allow a more detailed view of each model
MultiLights - The scene has 3 Lights that move around the scene and are used in conjunction with PBR
Toon Shading - I have included Toon Shading into the scene to give a better aesthetic that I like
SpotLight - I have implemented a solo light that rotates around the scene
Fog - I have included the use of fog to give a more unqiue aesthetic like showing off a new phone
Multiple Textures - On some objects, through the use of blinnPhong model, the use of multiple or singular textures have been applied to the models
Skybox - The scene is surrounded by a Skybox

### Libraries
#### Please ensure these libraries are in User/Public/OPENGL  in order to run the scene as intended

 - GLFW
 - GLM
 - STB_IMAGE
 - GLAD

### External Resource

#### In this project the use of learnopengl.com was essential in both learning the correct usage for each element 
#### This was extremely useful resource as it held all the download links for the libraries I needed

#### Model for phone were taken from [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/iphone13-1942592)
